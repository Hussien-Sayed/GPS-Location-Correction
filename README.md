# GPS-Location-Correction

The objective of this project is to enhance the accuracy of distance measurement in a run-tracking app. The task involved working with two distance measurement sources: one highly accurate source serving as a benchmark and another with noticeable inaccuracies.To achieve this, a predictive model capable of minimizing the discrepancies between the two sources.

The dataset is provided by Microsoft-IEEE-Optomatica.
